          Getting Started
      </div>
      <div class="content">
          Possibly like many others, we started out by first learning OpenGL from a course on youtube by The Chernoâ„¢. We set up our workspace using GLFW for making the window and GLEW
          for accessing OpenGL functions. We spent around a week getting acclimated to the state machine, figuring out how shaders work and finally drew an inconspicuous triangle
          (with color) using standard OpenGL functions. No "custom" code was written yet. We then decided to start off the actual assignment.

          This was pretty straighforward and we thought we coded it perfectly, until we realized we didn't...
          <div class="issue">
              <div class="issue-title">
                We didn't take into account lines whose first point's coordinates are higher than the second point's

              <div class="issue-fix">
                  Pretty simple fix. We added conditionals to check for it and set incx or incy appropriately
                  <div class="image">
                    <img src="incFix.png">

              </div>

          And then it worked:

          Overall, this part was pretty easy. We didn't experiment around much because well, we had much more interesting stuff ahead

          This, too was pretty straightforward

          This was a tad bit too boring, so we made the circle move based on mouse position

          We enhanced this further by simulating the circle tool present in design apps, where you can choose the centre and radius interactively

          Plotting Vector Fields
      </div>
      <div class="content">
          Now for the interesting part. We cycled through points set at a fixed spacing and computed the vector at each of those points. They were then drawn using the aforementioned
          line drawing algorithm. If (x,y) was the point, then the line was drawn from (x,y) to (x + vectorField(x,y).x , y + vectorField(x,y).y)
          <div class="image">
            <img src="firstField.png">
            <div class="label">
              Vector field of xi + yj
            </div>
          </div>
          Of course, this was just the first step. The scaling was not proper, so the next thing we did is add a scaling factor and draw the line from 
          (x,y) to (x + scalar * vectorField(x,y).x , y + scalar * vectorField(x,y).y)
          <div class="image">

            <div class="label">
              Vector field of xi + yj

          <div class="image">
            <img src="scaledField2.png">
            <div class="label">
              Vector field of yi - xj

            <img src="scaledField3.png">
            <div class="label">
              Vector field of (x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>)i + (x<sup>2</sup>-y<sup>2</sup>)j
            </div>
          </div>
          We might start to see a problem here. The scaling factor should increase as the order of the vector field increases so as to meaningfully scale every vector in sight.

            <img src="scaledScaledField.png">

          </div>
          This still looks crude. It's missing the crucial arrows! For computing the 3 points required for an arrow of a vector, we first normalized the vector in question,
          found out the two perpendiculars to it, and then transformed the heads of those perpendiculars to the right place. The two transformed heads along with the original head give us
          the 3 required points. We used the Bresenham's line algorithm to draw between these points

          </div>
          The next thing we wanted is for the field to be interactive. We wanted to be able to zoom in, change density, scaling, etc. We spent quite a bit of time refining the zooming
          feature. We also added tiny circles at the base of every vector for aesthetic
          <div class="image">
            <img src="zoom1.gif">
            <div class="label">
              Vector field of (xy-x<sup>2</sup>)i + (xy-y<sup>2</sup>)j
            </div>
          </div>
          We were changing the scaling too much on each render
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <div class="image">
            <img src="zoom2.gif">
            <div class="label">
              Vector field of (xy-x<sup>2</sup>)i + (xy-y<sup>2</sup>)j
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Density was not being affected so it doesn't feel like a real zoom</p>
          Eventually after quite a bit of trial and error, we arrived at the current zooming solution:
          There are 2 variables, zoom and sparsity. When scrolling the mouse wheel down, zoom and sparsity are divided by 1.1 and when it is scrolled up, they are nultiplied by 1.1.
          The vector that ends up at (x,y) is actually calculated at (x/zoom, y/zoom). Finally, to give the feeling of going farther or coming closer, the vector length is now
          vectorlength*zoom

            <img src="zoomFinal.gif">

      Playing around
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      One simple way to make the vector field look more appealing is to add color! Our initial, naive approach was this: Set the RG value for each pixel to be equal to its normalized
      coordinates with the B equal to 1. This was the result:
      <div class="image">
        <img src="color1.gif">
        <div class="label">
          Vector field of x<sup>2</sup>i + xyj
        </div>
      </div>
      We could have fixed the black quadrant by adjusting the values more carefully, but we deemed this coloring scheme unworthy of further experimentation as it was not dynamic at all.
      <p>The next scheme we tried out was setting the RG values of all pixels in a vector to the x and y components of that vector (B=1.0 again). This this what it looked like:</p>
      <div class="image">
        <img src="firstColorField1.png">
        <div class="label">
          Vector field of (x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>)i + (x<sup>2</sup>-y<sup>2</sup>)j
        </div>
      </div>
      Noticing closely, the arrows and the base circles are colored wrong. To fix this, we made the line drawing algorithm return the dx and dy and we passed them to the arrow and circle
      drawing functions.
      <div class="image">
        <img src="firstColorFieldFixed.png">

      </div>
      In general, the more x component the vector has, the more magenta it is and the more y component it has, the more cyan it is. Remember that blue appears where both are insignificant
      and white appears where both are significant

      A similar explosion, but two cutting across each other

      Unsurprisingly, this field looks similar to the one of xÂ²yi + yÂ²xj

      For a change, we mapped dx and dy to B and G leaving R at 1.0. The more x component a vector has, the more magenta it appears and the more y component it has, the more yellow it appears. This was so visually pleasing that we wanted to zoom out even more, but unfortunately had to stop because our laptops were fighting to survive. Speaking of that, let us analyse the
      running time of this algorithm.
