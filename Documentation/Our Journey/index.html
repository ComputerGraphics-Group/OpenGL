          Getting Started
      </div>
      <div class="content">
          Possibly like many others, we started out by first learning OpenGL from a course on youtube by The Cherno™. We set up our workspace using GLFW for making the window and GLEW
          for accessing OpenGL functions. We spent around a week getting acclimated to the state machine, figuring out how shaders work and finally drew an inconspicuous triangle
          (with color) using standard OpenGL functions. No "custom" code was written yet. We then decided to start off the actual assignment.

          This was pretty straighforward and we thought we coded it perfectly, until we realized we didn't...          
          We didn't take into account lines whose first point's coordinates are higher than the second point's
          Pretty simple fix. We added conditionals to check for it and set incx or incy appropriately

          Plotting Vector Fields
      </div>
      <div class="content">
          Now for the interesting part. We cycled through points set at a fixed spacing and computed the vector at each of those points. They were then drawn using the aforementioned
          line drawing algorithm. If (x,y) was the point, then the line was drawn from (x,y) to (x + vectorField(x,y).x , y + vectorField(x,y).y)
          <div class="image">

              Vector field of xi + yj
            </div>
          </div>
          Of course, this was just the first step. The scaling was not proper, so the next thing we did is add a scaling factor and draw the line from 
          (x,y) to (x + scalar * vectorField(x,y).x , y + scalar * vectorField(x,y).y)

            </div>
          </div>
          We might start to see a problem here. The scaling factor should increase as the order of the vector field increases so as to meaningfully scale every vector in sight.

          This still looks crude. It's missing the crucial arrows! For computing the 3 points required for an arrow of a vector, we first normalized the vector in question,
          found out the two perpendiculars to it, and then transformed the heads of those perpendiculars to the right place. The two transformed heads along with the original head give us
          the 3 required points. We used the Bresenham's line algorithm to draw between these points

          The next thing we wanted is for the field to be interactive. We wanted to be able to zoom in, change density, scaling, etc. We spent quite a bit of time refining the zooming
          feature. We also added tiny circles at the base of every vector for aesthetic
          <div class="image">
            <img src="zoom1.gif">
            <div class="label">
              Vector field of (xy-x<sup>2</sup>)i + (xy-y<sup>2</sup>)j

          </div>
          We were changing the scaling too much on each render
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <div class="image">

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Density was not being affected so it doesn't feel like a real zoom</p>
          Eventually after quite a bit of trial and error, we arrived at the current zooming solution:
          There are 2 variables, zoom and sparsity. When scrolling the mouse wheel down, zoom and sparsity are divided by 1.1 and when it is scrolled up, they are nultiplied by 1.1.
          The vector that ends up at (x,y) is actually calculated at (x/zoom, y/zoom). Finally, to give the feeling of going farther or coming closer, the vector length is now
          vectorlength*zoom
          <div class="image">
            <img src="zoomFinal.gif">
            <div class="label">

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>PolyLines</p>
          We can use the general idea of vector field and apply it in a different method to generate interesting results. Namely, we only generate lines at the endpoints of other lines. We start at a random point (x,y),
          generate the endpoint of this line f(x,y) and draw a line there. Then we take f(x,y) as the new start point and generate f(f(x,y)) as its endpoint, and so on.
          Most functions we used in the vector field example, such as x<sup>2</sup>yi + xy<sup>2</sup>j, grow too fast to be reliably seen in display. However there are certain classes of functions which can be seen.
          For example, the function f(x,y) = (y-x,-x-y) generates a square.
          <div class="image">
            <img src="polyline1.jpg">

              Note that any starting point generates a square not matter where it is, except for (0,0) trivially
            </div>
          </div>  
          With further experimentation, we observed that we can generate spiral shaped patterns by using a formula of the form f(x,y) = (ax+by,-x-y), or more generally (ax+by,-cx-dy). Given are two examples.

      Playing around
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      One simple way to make the vector field look more appealing is to add color! Our initial, naive approach was this: Set the RG value for each pixel to be equal to its normalized
      coordinates with the B equal to 1. This was the result:
      <div class="image">
        <img src="color1.gif">
        <div class="label">
          Vector field of x<sup>2</sup>i + xyj
        </div>
      </div>
      We could have fixed the black quadrant by adjusting the values more carefully, but we deemed this coloring scheme unworthy of further experimentation as it was not dynamic at all.
      <p>The next scheme we tried out was setting the RG values of all pixels in a vector to the x and y components of that vector (B=1.0 again). This this what it looked like:</p>
      <div class="image">
        <img src="firstColorField1.png">
        <div class="label">
          Vector field of (x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>)i + (x<sup>2</sup>-y<sup>2</sup>)j
        </div>
      </div>
      Noticing closely, the arrows and the base circles are colored wrong. To fix this, we made the line drawing algorithm return the dx and dy and we passed them to the arrow and circle
      drawing functions.

      </div>
      In general, the more x component the vector has, the more magenta it is and the more y component it has, the more cyan it is. Remember that blue appears where both are insignificant
      and white appears where both are significant

      For a change, we mapped dx and dy to B and G leaving R at 1.0. The more x component a vector has, the more magenta it appears and the more y component it has, the more yellow it
      appears. This was so visually pleasing that we wanted to zoom out even more, but unfortunately had to stop because our laptops were fighting to survive. Speaking of that, let us
      analyse the running time of this algorithm.

      To take a look at the performance, we set up a timer that starts right before computing all the required points and stops when that is done. We did not measure the time it takes
      for OpenGL to draw those points as it is not in our hands anyways. We used a test field, xy<sup>2</sup>i + x<sup>2</sup>yj. This is what it looks like:

      These were the results as we gradually zoomed out:

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      All the times are in milliseconds. We can make a few observations from this:
      <ul>
        <li>
          It's generally taking more and more time per render as we increases the density. An outlier is iteration 23, which took significanly lower time than the previous.
          We ran the test for this field multiple times and this pattern showed itself on every run. In fact, even in different fields, one particular iteration always ended up showing
          this phenomenon.
        </li>
        <li>
          Average time per point is unstable in the first few iterations, but stabilizes near the end. The reason for this is almost definitely the error in measurement of very low
          millisecond values in the beginning
        </li>
        <li>
          There are way too many points; much more than we expected. The total number of unique points is only supposed to be 1000*1000 as that is the resolution of our window. Our
          implementation resulted in more time taken as well as memory usage. The 28th iteration took as long as 9.6 seconds and peaked at 10.8 GB of RAM usage.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Attempting to optimize</h2>
      We're not sure why the first observation occurs and the second observation is not worth pondering. The third one however, has room for improvement.
      <p>We theorized that the reason there are so many points are because of 2 reasons: Points outside the window and duplicates.</p>
      <h3>Points outside the window:</h3>
      This happens because even though we are looping across only base points contained in the window, the lines drawn from there might not be. Considering the circumstances, a sophisticated
      clipping algorithm like Cohen Sutherland's is unnecessary. Instead, we can just add this one line in the line drawing function inside the for loop:
      <div class="one-line-code">
        <div class="image">
          <img src="clippingCode.png">
          <div class="label">
            Code to check for points out of window
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      Since we know that the base is always inside the window, we just have to check if any point drawn from the base falls outside. If it does, then we exit the function immediately as
      the line is clipped from there on. (We still have to return dx and dy for the coloring of the base circle). Let's see if the number of points decreases

        </div>
      </div>
      This is a significant reduction in time and memory consumed per render because of the reduced number of points. The higher the iteration, the more the improvement; the 28th
      iteration being literally 17 times faster and using less than 1 GB of RAM. Another interesting observation is that the "iteration 23" phenomenon is being replicated in others
      too, notably in 25 and 27. 
      <br>
      <h3>Duplicate points:</h3>
      Due to the way we are computing vectors, there are bound to be instances where multiple points in the array have the same coordinates. This will be negligible in low densities
      but will become noticable when many vectors intersect. For fixing these redundancies, we tried to implement a 1001x1001 boolean array which would contain data of which pixels
      have been plotted. This would take up 1 MB in the memory but would cap the max number of points at 1002001. However, after enough segmentation faults and program crashes, we gave up
      on the idea and it turns out that the timing would be barely (if at all) impacted. In iteration 28, we would have computed 21,155,565 lesser points which seems like a lot at first,
      but the time reduction would be just 116 milliseconds without taking into account the time for conditional operations that would be performed on each point. This is also the
      iteration above which the field becomes so dense that increasing the density even further would not be productive. Okay, roughly 337 MB would be saved in memory but we are 
      conveniently ignoring that

      Another interesting variation on the vector field is applying the function not on a vector but rather the color of the point. The result is functionally the same except that the
      resultant viewport displays some fascinating color schemes at low sparsity.
